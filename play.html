        <h5>ACT IV.

            SCENE.--_Antechamber of the CZAR'S private room. Large window at the
            back, with drawn curtains over it._</h5>
        
                
  <h6> PRINCE PETRO.</h6> <p>He is beginning well, this young Czar.</p>

<h6>BARON RAFF</h6> <p>(_shrugs his shoulders_).</p><p> All young Czars do begin well.

COUNT R. And end badly.</p>

<h6>MARQ. DE POIV.</h6> <p> I have no right to complain. He has done me one
good service, at any rate.</p>

<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6> <p>Cancelled your appointment to Archangel, I suppose?</p>

<h6>MARQ. DE POIV.</h6> <p>Yes; my head wouldn't have been safe there for an
hour.</p>

<p>(_Enter GENERAL KOTEMKIN._)</p>

<h6>BARON RAFF. <h6><p>Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor?</p>

<h6>GEN. KOTEMK.</h6> <p>You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago
I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling
players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be
recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.</p>

<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6><p> Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than
common murderers!</p>

<h6>COUNT R.</h6><p> And the other half much worse?</p>

<h6>BARON RAFF.</h6> <p>Oh, you wrong them, surely, Count. Wholesale trade has
always been more respectable than retail.</p>
